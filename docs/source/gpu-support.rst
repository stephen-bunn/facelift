GPU Support
===========

To drastically speed up the processing and detection of face features we need to
manually build both ``opencv`` and ``dlib`` for the machine's GPU.
To do this we need to override the prebuilt CPU-only libraries included in the default
installation of the package.

.. tip::
   I'm going to try and get a guide together for building ``opencv-python`` and ``dlib``
   with GPU support after a ``v1.0.0`` release as it is a secondary milestone for this
   project.
